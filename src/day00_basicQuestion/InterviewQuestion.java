//	A class — in the context of Java — is a template or blue print used to create objects 
//	and to define object data types and methods.
	
//	A Java object is a member (also called an instance) of a Java class. 
//	Each object has an identity, a behavior and a state. 
//	The state of an object is stored in fields (variables), 
//	while methods (functions) display the object.
	
//	A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects.
//	Note that the constructor name must match the class name, and it cannot have a return type (like void).
	
//	A return statement causes the program control to transfer back to the caller of a method.
//			
//	Parameters are the variables that are listed as part of a method declaration. 
//	Each parameter must have a unique name and a defined data type.
//	
//	Static members are data members (variables) or methods that belong to a static or a non static class itself, 
//	rather than to objects of the class. 
//	Static members always remain the same, regardless of where and how they are used.
//	
//	Encapsulation in Java is for storing the data members and data methods of a class together. 
//	It is done in the form of a secure field accessible by only the members of the same class. 
//	(for hide variable for modify data)
	
//	Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) 
//	and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, 
//	the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, 
//	and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.

//	Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. 
//	The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes.
	
//	The super keyword in java is a reference variable that is used to refer parent class objects.
 
//	OOPS Concept - Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, 
//	Polymorphism(Overloading/ comply time, Overriding/ Run time)
//	OOPs Concept APIE is 4 tiers that have Abstraction Polymorphism Inheritance Encapsulation
//	Overloading is compile time with same method with different parameter
//	Overriding is run time with same method and same parameter
