/*
 * Your job is to create a simple banking application.

Implement the following classes:

## 1. Bank Class

- It has two fields, A `String` called `name` and an `ArrayList` that holds objects of type `Branch`
  called `branches`.
- A constructor that takes a `String` (name of the bank). It initialises `name` and instantiates
  `branches`.
- And five methods, they are (their functions are in their names):
    - `addBranch()`, has one parameter of type `String` (name of the branch) and returns a `boolean`
      . It returns `true` if the branch was added successfully or `false` otherwise.
    - `addCustomer()`, has three parameters of type `String` (name of the branch), `String` (name of
      the customer), `double` (initial transaction) and returns a `boolean`. It returns `true` if
      the customer was added successfully or `false` otherwise.
    - `addCustomerTransaction()`, has three parameters of type `String` (name of the branch)
      , `String` (name of the customer), `double` (transaction) and returns a `boolean`. It
      returns `true` if the customers transaction was added successfully or `false` otherwise.
    - `findBranch()`, has one parameter of type `String` (name of the Branch) and returns a `Branch`
      . Return the `Branch` if it exists or `null` otherwise.
    - `listCustomers()`, has two parameters of type `String` (name of the Branch), `boolean` (print
      transactions) and returns a `boolean`. Return `true` if the branch exists or `false`
      otherwise. This method prints out a list of customers.

**→ TEST CODE**

```java
class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Bank bank = new Bank("National Australia Bank");

      bank.addBranch("Adelaide");

      bank.addCustomer("Adelaide", "Tim", 50.05);
      bank.addCustomer("Adelaide", "Mike", 175.34);
      bank.addCustomer("Adelaide", "Percy", 220.12);

      bank.addCustomerTransaction("Adelaide", "Tim", 44.22);
      bank.addCustomerTransaction("Adelaide", "Tim", 12.44);
      bank.addCustomerTransaction("Adelaide", "Mike", 1.65);

      bank.listCustomers("Adelaide", true);
   }
}
```

**→ OUTPUT**

The `listCustomers()` should be printed out in the following format if boolean parameter is `true`:

```text
Customer details for branch Adelaide 
Customer: Tim[1]
Transactions
[1]  Amount 50.05
[2]  Amount 44.22
[3]  Amount 12.44 
Customer: Mike[2]
Transactions
[1]  Amount 175.34
[2]  Amount 1.65 
Customer: Percy[3]
Transactions
[1]  Amount 220.12
```

and if `false`, only the customers - no transactions:

```java
bank.listCustomers("Adelaide", false);
```
```text
Customer details for branch Adelaide 
Customer: Tim[1]
Customer: Mike[2]
Customer: Percy[3]
```

## 2. Branch Class

- It has two fields, A `String` called `name` and an `ArrayList` that holds objects of
  type `Customer`
  called `customers`.
- A constructor that takes a `String` (name of the branch). It initialises `name` and instantiates
  `customers`.
- And five methods, they are (their functions are in their names):
    - `getName()`, getter for `name`.
    - `getCustomers()`, getter for `customers`.
    - `newCustomer()`, has two parameters of type `String` (name of customer), `double` (initial
      transaction)
      and returns a `boolean`. Returns `true` if the customer was added successfully or `false`
      otherwise.
    - `addCustomerTransaction()`, has two parameters of type `String` (name of customer), `double` (
      transaction) and returns a `boolean`. Returns `true` if the customers transaction was added
      successfully or `false` otherwise.
    - `findCustomer()`, has one parameter of type `String` (name of customer) and returns
      a `Customer`. Return the `Customer` if they exist, `null` otherwise.

## 3. Customer Class

- It has two fields, A `String` called `name` and an `ArrayList` that holds objects of type `Double`
  called
  `transactions`.
- A constructor that takes a `String` (name of customer) and a `double` (initial transaction). It
  initialises `name` and instantiates `transactions`.
- And three methods, they are (their functions are in their names):
    - `getName()`, getter for `name`.
    - `getTransactions()`, getter for `transactions`.
    - `addTransaction()`, has one parameter of type `double` (transaction) and doesn't return
      anything.

#### TIPS:

- In **Bank**, use the `findBranch()` method in each of the other four methods to validate a branch.
  Do the same thing in **Branch** with `findCustomer()` - except for the two getters.
- In **Customer**, think about what else you need to do in the constructor when you instantiate a
  **Customer** object.
- Think about what methods you need to call from another class when implementing a method.
- Be extremely careful with the spelling of the names of the fields, constructors and methods.
- Be extremely careful about spaces and spelling in the printed output.

#### NOTE:

- All transactions are deposits (no withdraws/balances).
- All fields are **private**.
- All constructors are **public**.
- All methods are **public** (except for `findBranch()` and `findCustomer()` which are `private`).
- There are no **static** members.
- Do not add a **main** method to the solution code.
